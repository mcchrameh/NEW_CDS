# NEW_CDS
New parallel version of dynamic cell simulation
This version has been tested with 2048 X 2048 grid points, on  16 cores. There are some functions in the header file (CahnH.h) that needs improving. For example WriteToFile_MPI(MPI_Comm new_comm), ReadFile(std::ifstream& infile). These functions make use of MPI I/O but are  not properly implemented in this case. The difference between this version and the previous version is that, this version splits both rows and columns and can simulate a huge number of points. The previous version splits only rows and becomes inefficient interms of memory when a large number of grid points is considered.
